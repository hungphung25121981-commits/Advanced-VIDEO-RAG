"""Direct visual question-answering from concrete frame image(s).

`generator.py`'s `synthesize_answer` answers from TEXT captions only
(image_paths=None) -- good for "what error message appeared" style
questions where the OCR/caption text already has the answer. But
counting-style questions ("bao nhieu nguoi dang an?" -> "2") need the
model to actually LOOK at the frame, so this module sends the real
image(s) to the same Qwen2.5-VL engine instead of just its caption.

Used by `main.py query --q` (search then answer from the resolved
top-1 frame) and `query --qa` (answer from a frame_id already recorded
in an existing --out-csv, no search).
